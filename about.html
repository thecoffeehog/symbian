			<caption><h2>About Site</h3></caption>
				<p>
				Close to thousand students leave SIT after completing their four amazing years here at SIT.
				They make lots of friends,acquaintances and many other relationships while they lived at SIT.
                But there is still no platform for them to maintain their relationships with all those acquaintances and friends they made at SIT. <br><br>
				Social networking sites like Facebook may come to their help but no one adds all their batchmates on their Facebook account and they would still like to stay updated about them, what they are doing with their lives, where they are working, in which city are they living and many more things.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				SYMBIAN deals with making a database of alumni students so that a network stays established between them even when they leave college.
